# Mutation testing for Rust code. Validates test quality by introducing
# small changes and checking if tests catch them.

# Install: cargo install cargo-mutants
# Run: cargo mutants
# Run specific module: cargo mutants -f src/vad.rs

# Exclude files that are hard to test or have external dependencies

    "src/main.rs",           # Entry point
    "src/commands.rs",       # Tauri commands need app context
    "src/pipeline.rs",       # Thread-based, hard to unit test
]

# Timeout for each mutant (some tests are slow)

# Number of parallel jobs

# Minimum test timeout
minimum_test_timeout = "60s"

# Continue testing after first failure (get full report)
